# JavaThreadsDemo

This project demonstrates the use of Java Threads using modular and well-commented code. It follows best coding practices and includes:

## Files
- **Main.java**: Contains the `main()` method, creates and starts threads.
- **IncrementThread.java**: Custom thread class that continuously increments a number by a fixed step and prints the result at intervals.

## Functionality
- `IncrementThread.run()`: The main logic of each thread, prints the current value, increments it, and sleeps for a delay.
- `IncrementThread(...)`: Constructor initializes the values.
